          , craving some caffeine. In search of a coffee fix, I check Google
          Maps to find the closest coffee place, and to my delight, I discover
          one just a three-minute walk away - perfect!
          <p>
            I make my way there and order my usual morning coffee, C&#224; ph&#234; s&#7919;a 
            with ice, as the weather is already sweltering hot. Shortly after, I
            receive my coffee and take that eagerly awaited first sip. Despite
            my sleepiness, I&apos;m instantly amazed by the taste, and an
            unconscious smile spreads across my face. By now, I&apos;m well
            acquainted with the art of enjoying Vietnamese coffee, knowing
            it&apos;s best to savor it slowly. So I take my time, relishing
            every sip, while observing my surroundings.
          </p>
          <p>
            I realize that I&apos;ve stumbled upon a wonderfully relaxed caf√©.
            At this moment, I&apos;m the only customer (later discovering it to
            be an exception), and the barista who served me is seated across the
            room, absorbed in his computer.
          </p>
          <p>
            At one point, he approaches me and asks where I&apos;m from.
            &ldquo;Switzerland&rdquo; I reply, and our conversation begins. We
            quickly discover our shared love for good coffee, and I express to
            him that the coffee I&apos;m currently sipping is the best I&apos;ve
            had throughout my journey in Vietnam.
